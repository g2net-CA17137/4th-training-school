## Run the tutorials on Google Colab

If you run the tutorials on Google Colab you need to install the specific package needed in each tutorial and this can be done removing the `#` in the line at the top of the tutorial containing someting like:

`#! pip install -q 'gwosc==0.5.4`

and then running the remaining line `! pip install -q 'gwosc==0.5.4`

In one tutorial a donwgrade of matplotlib is also needed, so read carefully the commented text.

See also the warnings in the section labelled "Option 2" in [this setup page](https://github.com/gw-odw/odw-2022/blob/main/setup.md)

If you want to run the tutorlias on your laptop you need to follow the guidelines labelled "Option 3" in [this setup page](https://github.com/gw-odw/odw-2022/blob/main/setup.md) and install the correct conda version.
